Hi David!

It was good to see Cava again!

The only issue here is the path to the JS file - you have

<script src="../Assignment-2/index.js" defer></script>

I needed to change it to

<script src="./index.js" defer></script>

To see your work. Once I did everything worked great.

Very well done, Välgodkänt!
